    <!-- * The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz."
    Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

    * Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions.
    The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

    * Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score.
    Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

    * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered,
    the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials.
    Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`.

    * Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
